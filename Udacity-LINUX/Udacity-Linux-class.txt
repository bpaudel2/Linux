Lesson 2:
Files in Linux:
Linux is very flexible about filename. The files system does not require that file have extension at the end of their
filename.arrow 
Using up arrow keys, you will be able to see recently used command but you can also
use 
history //to see history of command 
Ctrl + R //Reverse-i-search: to search recently used command.
unzip filename //to unzip the zipped file
cat file1 file2 //to read file
tab multiple times auto complete the command
wc filename // word count, it tells how many lines, words and bytes in a file
diff file1 file2 // gives the different between two files
man command_name //to learn more about command
ls -a // to list all the files
ls -l // to see more information about file (long listing)
rm -rf // recursive deleting with forcefully
ping 8.8.8.8//used to test whether another machine in internet is alive.
sort // sort the things you provide, type sort and provide things to be sorted, at the end provide Ctrl+D (END OF FILE CHARACTER)
bc // a basic calculators 
less filename // display file content, arrow keys to scroll up and down
    use D key or space bar for scroll up and down
    scroll one page at a time by U key
    skip last line of file using > 
    < to go to first line of file
    enter line number to go to specific line
    type /searchString to search for that String and press enter to execute the search, find next occurence of search by pressing n key, to go previous occurence use N, searches are case sensitive,

    move around with arrow key, at the buttom there are some command


Files and Directories:
Files name in Linux are flexible. You can spaces, dot and everything except /.
If there are spaces in line name use either single quote, or back slash(\) skipping character.
Linux uses forward slash and Windows uses back slash.
workig directory: pwd //print working directory
cd //to change working directory
cd .. //to up the directory
Top most directory in filesystem is root. We denote it with slash(/)
Absolute path: full path begining with slash
Relative path: path from current working directory.
. refers to current directory.
.. points to parent directory.
~ is abbreviation for your home directory. Exp ~/desktop/
cd with no arguments will take you to your home directory

Moving and Copying Files:
mv //move files, or rename files
cp //to copy files
mkdir //to create new Directories
rmdir //to delete the directoryy 
rm -r //if directory has files in it

Globbing
    matching files by name. pattern matching file for filename.
    ls *html //to see all html files. * matches zero or many characters
    ls app.{css,html} //either app.css or app.html
    ? matches any one character
    [abcde] matches any one of the character inside square bracket.
    Filename in Linux are case sensitive. 
    ls *{jpg,png} is equivalent to ls *jpg *png
    echo prints on the command line. 
    echo Short names:
